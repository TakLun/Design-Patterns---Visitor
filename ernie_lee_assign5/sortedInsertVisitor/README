PURPOSE:

[
	The purpose of this assignment is to create two visitors and apply it to two different elements.
	The assignment allows the user to be more familiar with programming the visitor pattern and to become familiar with its uses

BUGS:

[
	None

FILES:

[
	FileProcessor.java, The file that habdles all of the file functions needed for the program to run. It opens, and closes the file, as well as reading and returning the integer values from the text.
	MyADT.java, Interface that provides the data structures the required methods needed for the visitors to apply their algorithm.
	MyArray.java, file that internally holds an array that stores integers
	MyVector.java, file that internally holds a vector that stores integers
	SlowInsertVisitor.java, Visitor that has methods to take in their respective data structures and perform an algorithm on it. It first inserts the integer gathered from the text file to the back of the data structure and then sorts it.
	SortedInsertVisitor.java, Visitor that has methods to take in their respective data structures and perform an algorithm on it. It takes the integer from the text file and directly inserts it in its respective index of the data structure.
	Visitor.java, Interface that provides the visitors the required methods to perform their algorithm on their respective data structures.
	Driver.java, the main file associated with the sortedInsertVisitor program that also contains main
	README, the text file currently being read
